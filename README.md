# Gorkha-Nepal-Earthquake-Amplification-Signal-Processing
This document contains the report generated for the Gorkha, Nepal ground motion statistics. The MATLAB code used to process the raw time series data is included.
The aim of this project was to quantify the amount of ground motion amplification that occurred at two seismic sites in Nepal.
